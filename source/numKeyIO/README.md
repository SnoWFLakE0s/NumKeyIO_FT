# NumKey I/O
___
This program provides an interfacing framework for multiple-key numpad layouts. A prime example of such a layout would be the 10-key layout:
```
|7|8|9|
|4|5|6|
|1|2|3|
  |0|
```
The NumKey framework provides users the ability to easily take inputs from these numpads and output a number.
